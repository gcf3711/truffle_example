   Replacing 'GoodTimeCoin'
   ------------------------
 *** Deployment Failed ***

"GoodTimeCoin" ran out of gas. Something in the constructor (ex: infinite loop) caused gas estimation to fail. Try:
   * Making your contract constructor more efficient
   * Setting the gas manually in your config or as a deployment parameter
   * Using the solc optimizer settings in 'truffle-config.js'
   * Setting a higher network block limit if you are on a
     private network or test client (like ganache).


Exiting: Review successful transactions manually by checking the transaction hashes above on Etherscan.
